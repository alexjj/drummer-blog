			<description>Every year I think about doing NaNoWrite but always do nothing. This year I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo late to start thinking about it‚Äù‚Ä¶What I should do is just write crap for month because it‚Äôs better than doing nothing. I get too bogged down in process and not action.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://youneedastereo.com/#2021-10-21%20Journal&quot;&gt;@Phil&lt;/a&gt;, we were one step away from finding your house and standing over you until you made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/&quot;&gt;Drummer blog&lt;/a&gt; :) Welcome! It took me a few days to figure it out, and I still use my Tiddlywiki, and it's somewhat random what goes where, but the wiki tends to be more chatty, least at the moment. I'm intrigued you &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/2021/10/21.html#a151655&quot;&gt;find Drummer easier to use&lt;/a&gt; than Tiddlywiki on the phone. I can't see anything when I open drummer on my phone, I turn it landscape but it's all overflowing, but TW fits to the screen.</description>

			<title>Drummer Tweaks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Noticed the tabs on drummer blogs don‚Äôt look very good when on mobile, I should look into the CSS to see if those can be a bit nicer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ended up removing the updated time at the top and letting the tabs' size just go off the text. They're all about the same size anyway so not that noticeable but it makes them much nicer on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also offers room for a lot more!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tidied up the about page a little&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Using html headers seemed to make it add blank lines, so adopted a more outliner appropriate format üòÅ&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Made the archives just Month links, will manually add those&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Removed reference to the standalone page, I'll still keep it in the outline so I don't forget the syntax but commented out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/&quot;&gt;Phil's fresh blog&lt;/a&gt; made me wonder about having a very clean looking one with no tabs. A bit like how a &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexjj.com/2021/10/21.html&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexjj.com/2021/10/&quot;&gt;month view&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Not sure about the...About page though. Would be nice to have that as this is now my main page. Unless I did a very small feature at the top, like a pinned post. The first post being a hard coded about.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Links would be missing too but not so bothered about that. I'd just write an entry instead, which might be more meaningful. If the link is that good I'll add it to the wiki. I'm not even sure I like that Radio3 posts to my twitter. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Got rid of the Twitter connect and version number. I don't need it or bothered about other people tweeting my site.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The font awesome social icons in the footer just do not work for me whatsoever. Either weird symbols appear or only RSS depending on browser.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The CSS/js imports in the html template make it look like the kitchen sink is also rendered.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Had to cut the lawn, although it's been raining for weeks and it's still wet, but I did it anyway. I usually listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://talkpython.fm/&quot;&gt;talkpython.fm&lt;/a&gt; podcast but the most recent ones looked boring from my perspective. So I thought I'd search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;. I'd not really heard of him until I somehow got to know about Drummer (most likely via &lt;a href=&quot;https://baty.blog/&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt;). I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://thisweekinstartups.com/e1133-podcast-blogging-pioneer-dave-winer-on-inventing-new-forms-of-media-tribalism-on-social-media-tales-of-the-golden-age-of-silicon-valley-more/&quot;&gt;this one from Nov 2020&lt;/a&gt;.  It's fascinating to listen to the early days of the internet, and generally any of Dave's stories from the early days of tech and silicon valley (including meeting with Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and others back in the early days). It was also during peak COVID lockdown.</description>

			<title>Drummer Blog Pages</title>

			<title>Drummer Blog Backups</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how good software is, something will break. Therefore it's best to backup!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Reliable backup is complex and I'm not going to try and admit I'm an expert or even know anything about it. This is just the first steps I've taken&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is also focusing just on your blog, not other outlines you may have in Drummer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, when you make your &lt;code&gt;blog.opml&lt;/code&gt; public, it's exactly that. Public. This means you can download it at your leisure. Also true for About or other public outlines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yours will be &lt;code&gt;http://drummer.scripting.com/your-twitter-handle/blog.opml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexjj/drummer-blog/blob/main/backup.sh&quot;&gt;simple bash script&lt;/a&gt; that curl's the file and commits it to a git repo and pushes to github. My computer runs it every 15 minutes via cron. Systemd timers also available.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is also in the same repo that I host the template files and images, published via Github pages to use with Drummer. This is helpful to track changes to my CSS or template index.html, not that I've done very much so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/11/190447.html?title=itsReallyEasyToBackUp&quot;&gt;Dave shows you how to do&lt;/a&gt; a really simple and easy backup of all your drummer outlines.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you hover over that &lt;i&gt;Download my files&lt;/i&gt; menu you'll see a URL with tokens and secrets. No doubt that can be used to get the files too.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next step in this would be to use Drummer's own &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;scripting tools&lt;/a&gt;, even including &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml#1628460028000&quot;&gt;scheduled scripts&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;insert backup system&gt;'s API to automate backup of your outlines.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fuji Film Simulations</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think it's time I worked out my own ones. It's only been 4 years of using Fuji and I'm yet to do it. Mostly just taken ones from online, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-iii-recipes/&quot;&gt;Fujix weekly's&lt;/a&gt;, or other random places. Right now I have two that I use a lot, and two others that I occasionally use but then like them when I remember. The other 3 are just entries I have to jog over to get to what I want. I should also order them in how I want to use them. E.g. top is favourite colour, then favourite B&amp;W, and last another favourite (as my custom button means I can press it then up or down to get to another custom settings).  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tethered FujiFilm X raw studio should be useful for this but requiring tethering is a bit of a pain. Last time I tried it got upset and stopped working or something equally frustrating. It does help me get the image on the big screen so I can see if Shadows needs another -1 or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hmm...The needs a camera is usb 3 micro b cable...&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Classic chrome is generally my favourite colour simulation, although sometimes it's a little grungy for family photos. The classic neg in the newer camera models looks a bit nicer but I'm not buying a newer model for a film simulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The newer models do offer more customisation though...I'll wait for the X-T5/6 to be released then maybe it'll be time to get the X-T3 (assuming it has what I'm looking for).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Acros is by far my favourite black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Film data imprinting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Several cameras offer the ability to imprint data on the film, such as time, date, but more interestingly is shutter speed and aperture. Most do it via a special back. I don't want it on the photo (and I don't want date/time) but between them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part is finding available backs.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Minolta Dynax/Maxxum 7 has a data recorder on the camera. So no imprinting but saved for later retrieval via the menus. I guess that's something, but I'd have to remember to write it out. Fortunately it saves 7 films so in my typical batch of 3-4 for development should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.friedmanarchives.com/minolta-maxxum-dynax-7/&quot;&gt;Gary helps explain&lt;/a&gt; why I want a 7.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I ordered 2x B&amp;W film development and scanning from &lt;a href=&quot;https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/collections/film-developing&quot;&gt;Analogue Wonderland&lt;/a&gt;. They had a 20% off promo that ended last night.  Even with the promo filmdev is cheaper for C-41. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I had my own scanner then it might be worthwhile as you can do ¬£6 development then scan myself, and that includes postage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I'll develop my own black and white. Not sure about colour. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also started browsing black and white film stocks....there's quite a lot which could be fun. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Still not sure where this site fits. It definitely doesn't take over Tiddlywiki. It might take over my blog, but it's a different type of blogging. It's more like the short posts I do on the blog vs. the long ones. However, this blog would most likely be much more active that my current one. I could also capture the long posts that I want categorised in the wiki. OR I could keep both TW and the blog and &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt; this as another blogging site. I'm thinking as my home domain, alexjj.com. That way I can still link to the blog for longer stuff I want to add (which I should also just make copies of in the wiki - or in fact draft them in the wiki) and then have the wiki for random gibbering, plus wiki stuff and then this as a slightly more refined blog/home page. I might tweak the index.html to have &quot;an about&quot; at the top. It's quite the all-in mode but this is a much better static gen site than I used to have and whilst I do like my novelty css alexjj.com landing page, it's a little pointless. hmm have to think about it some more.</description>

			<description>Decided (for now) instead of a GRiii(x), I should get a 18mm lens for Fuji. The f/1.4 is nice but pricey and big, so sprung for the older 18mm f/2. It's tiny, light and has a cool square metal lens hood (that makes your photos look better). It gets a lot of hate online but most likely (a) it's fine, (b) I won't be able to tell. It'll be my Q2 üòÖ</description>

			<title>Fuji Portrait Lens</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in also getting the 60mm f/2.4 macro lens too. Another (according to the internet) a runt of the Fuji litter. I don't have anything fast in the range 50-90mm on APS-C. The macro feature tempts me for film scanning. The alternatives are the 50mm f/2, nice little lens, 56mm f/1.2, the classic portrait lens and that f/1.2 but big, the 90mm f/2, appears to be the &quot;best&quot; lens ever but even bigger, then 80mm macro, supposedly the best macro but also massive.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Oh and the 50mm f/1.0 ü§ë&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whilst I want the 56mm, I'm not sure I'd really use it that much, and probably better getting the 50mm f/2 for speed, weight and WR. Of course the 56mm is supposed to have &lt;i&gt;character&lt;/i&gt;. The 60mm is virtually same weight as 50mm f/2 and will have more compression with a bit longer plus, again, the macro function.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Drummer Pros</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This site is much more convenient for entering text throughout the day, and also just for general rearrangement of text. Images are a little more time consuming to setup, bit like how TW was before that uploader plugin, so not a huge deal. Plus most of the time I don't bother with images. Although I do like the little right aligned ones people drop in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's nice having other outliner files just here for private or draft stuff too. Or even just commenting out sections for later if I don't finish them in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's probably a lot more to the &quot;environment&quot; that I've not realised yet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was looking for a static generator and a web based editor system, &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; is what I was looking for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like the linklog, doesn't need explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Conclusion</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure today. It can't replace the wiki but how should I use them together. Duplicate info? TW is just for me and drummer is for the world (so more polished?) Drummer could take the place of my blog, and maybe that's the best thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So then where should it sit in my the domain structure?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rudimentarylathe.org/2021/10/17.html#a101131&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; - I think the ordering during a day only matters if you update yourself. e.g. trying to fix x at 10am. 6 hours later &quot;I found the solution&quot;. Then in time order makes more sense. Of course with an outliner style (vs. TW) you can always just do a new level underneath. Personally speaking, I like the idea of it being in the order of the day for when I go back and look at it and remember that day. I suppose it's easy to do with just reordering levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Writing this makes me wonder if a &quot;conversation&quot; section of the day makes sense - bit like how you started tagging things with conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Starting out with Drummer.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Actually this is the 3rd time but that's always the charm right?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amitgawande.com/2021/10/16/getting-started-blogging.html&quot;&gt;These notes&lt;/a&gt; are very useful to get going.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Setting up https and custom domain but it's getting a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had thought I could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexjj.github.io/drummer-blog/&quot;&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the static files but it doesn't seem to like it. Not quite sure why as it mostly renders the page but just not everything? ü§î Well I'll keep copyings in the git repo and just host on my own server. Having in git is handy but just a shame I can't use the hosting! &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I realised that I had omitted the https in the reference to the stylesheet and code, and GH pages only permits https then it probably isn't finding it...&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
