There's a few of them about but the youngest is probably the T450s ThinkPad with 5th gen intel. Windows 11 might run on it, but it's happily running GNU+Linux and my daughter uses it for her school work and so I don't have to worry about it. The others are 3rd and 4th gen intel cpus.

				<outline text="I have 31 pages left in my Leuchtturm1917 notebook. Last week I used 9 pages, this week so far I'm on page 4. At best I can scrape my way to the start of December but not sure I'll make it to Christmas. Would be nice to end the year in this notebook. Not that I ever go back and look in them, they sit on my desk but I start to forget what was in it and so don't look. I always start off trying to use the index but often there are 30 page gaps or I just stop. I suppose I'm not making useful entries? I always want to be more organised but find I just get away with remembering things, googling, searching old emails, or flicking back though my current notebook. I have a very small tiddlywiki for work which does work well...when I remember to update it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexjj.com/2021/10/26.html#a182206&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I was all about drummer for work but I'm not sure the tool is the issue. Thinking about an e-ink notebook is an (other vain?) attempt at trying to be more organised. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://supernote.com/&quot;&gt;supernote&lt;/a&gt; one has options for tags and table of contents or something, but that'll still rely on me using them when I write stuff down.

You can use iCloud sync or pay for their sync or maybe git via Working Copy. A quick test of it (on iPad) and the mobile app is very impressive, looks to have most, if not all, the features of the desktop app. Has a nice toolbar that you can customise, gestures to open command palette.  I think I like it more than the desktop app! If you just use Apple products, it's a pretty decent setup. If you paid for Publish it would make for a great experience. I just don't like the desktop app nor want to pay $192 / year for it.

Not sure how to do this on my iPad...perhaps a combo of looking up the day on the computer from the journal text and then just adding the picture in the app on iPad. It's a bit of a chore but would make a good christmas present for my wife. I told myself it would be a good anniversary present but too late for that now.

					<outline text="The fun of film is fixing what you get for the next 24/36 shots. I suppose midway rewinds are possible but that's just asking for trouble. The big choice is colour or black and white and then what ISO. There are other choices too but these are the main ones for me. ISO 400 is generally a good one for me as it let's me just get away with f/1.4-f/2 with 1/60s indoors and outdoors it's fine on overcast days. If it's sunny then it would be nice to make use of (generally) finer grained ISO 200 or ISO 100 films. Gives the photos a smooth, crisp look. The problem is you don't always know what you're going to be shooting, how many frames you'll use and how reliable the weather forecast is. A professional will mitigate these issues with multiple bodies or backs and probably take more photos than I would. This weekend was a particularly bad &lt;i&gt;series of unfortunate events&lt;/i&gt;, and I was all over the place. " created="Sun, 24 Oct 2021 21:02:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've been wanting to try some different black and white stocks, and had some cheap Kentmere 400. I'd also brought some Kodak ColorPlus (again cheap!) which is ISO 200. The B&amp;W was loaded first before we left and it was a beautifully sunny day. I used a whole roll without resorting to pointless shots, which is always nice, and didn't bother loading another as we were about to leave. To be organised, I decided to load the ISO 200 colour film that night ready for the next day. Oh, how grey and dull and dark is was, even outside! Trying to take pictures at 1/50s f/1.4, or trying 1/30s knowing that there's going to be movement. Clearly a flash or other light source would be helpful but I don't have one that works with my film camera. Down at f/1.4 is also pushing my focusing when everyone is running around. Oh how I wished I'd waited until the morning to load the film...there's a lesson for me...I could've pushed the film but I'm not confident cheap ColorPlus would handle that very well.

					<outline text="So back to another roll of Kentmere for the next day. It was more mixed in weather, plus I knew I'd be taking some photos inside. I'd also brought my digital camera and it's easy to forget that it can easily push ISO 6,400 before it looks bad and in B&amp;W ISO 12,800 even looks nice. Around the house it was 2500-3000 ish. So when I switch back to ISO 400, I realise this is still going to be tricky. So I decided I'll meter it for ISO &lt;b&gt;1600&lt;/b&gt;! +2 stops. Am I mad? The cheap stock pushed two stops?! Only one way to find out...We shall see how that goes. However, at 1600 I now have plenty of latitude and can start closing that aperature down a bit.

That way I can still link to the blog for longer stuff I want to add (which I should also just make copies of in the wiki - or in fact draft them in the wiki) and then have the wiki for random gibbering, plus wiki stuff and then this as a slightly more refined blog/home page. I might tweak the index.html to have &quot;an about&quot; at the top.
