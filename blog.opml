Last few years I've bought from inception hosting, they've always been reliable and decent, so tempted to upgrade my current VPS to their latest €15/year VPS and be done with it.

It's a 10 year old game, I already own the game on PC, and it's still not exactly cheap given it's so old. If it sells, of course they're going to try and get the most money they can for it. It does come with the DLCs and maybe it's been improved since the original in terms of bugs and whatever.

					<outline text="I've been critical of Apple and macOS in the past, and I've not used a Mac in years. That changed recently and now I have a Mac and am using macOS. The more I use it, the more I appreciate the details in it. Everything is unified in a much tighter and nicer way than Windows or Linux. I think GNOME or KDE on Linux does a decent job of it, or if you live entirely within emacs, but as a mainstream desktop OS, macOS is enjoyable.

There's probably other stuff but I've forgotten it or looked it up. Using  ⌘+C/V for copy and paste is going to be the biggest complaint from the family if I setup the main computer to be the Mac. Yes they can learn, but they don't use the computer enough to appreciate everything else to understand why they should learn.

Certainly on casual viewing, probably there are some differences at 100%. So whilst I wasn't that excited about it at 400, I'm very impressed with it at 1600. Could be a good B&amp;W stock for the winter months when I'm even looking for 1600 whilst outside!

					<outline text="The other day I was tidying my office. The clutter had slowly grown and it had become too annoying. I also had a bunch of things to do that I was putting off, like scanning some letters, storing boxes of (yet more) stuff I'd bought as well as just the tidy up itself. I had a stack of notebooks, a mix of Leuchturms, moleskins, random brands, but all about A5 size. I use these every day at work to track my weekly and daily to-dos, notes from meetings and general paper scratchpad for calcs or ideas. This stack probably went back to about 2018. What was I going to do with them?" created="Thu, 04 Nov 2021 11:54:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I probably spent a good 20 minutes just flicking through the pages - this is something I love about physical notebooks. The ease of rediscovery of previous entries. I've not found a digital equivalent that's quite so enjoyable. The &quot;on this day&quot; feature that many photo and journal apps have is nice but it’s just that day. There’s sometimes open a random entry or but the flicking through large time ranges and just having things jump out is much better." created="Thu, 04 Nov 2021 12:02:01 GMT">

					<outline text="At work, I always have my notebook with me. It's very quick to capture anything, I also think it's perceived as less rude than taking out a laptop. Pretty much as everyone thinks you're not paying attention whilst writing notes on it. Now of course I shouldn't care what other people think, but sometimes it &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; appropriate to take out a laptop. I also have a nice routine of weekly planning, and daily planning in my notebook. That's worked well for me for several years now and I shouldn't really change that.

					<outline text="The bulk of entries are transient, stuff that needed to be done that week, meetings about it, updates, which whilst important at the time, the information tends to become meaningless over time.

					<outline text="The obvious solution to saving this other important information is to extract it from the notebooks and into something more permanent, and probably something digital for longer term storage and searching. Maybe Tiddlywiki as it's a pretty nice application, very customisible and has a good long term viability. The problem is getting the data into it. It's going to take more time to do it, and time is always limited. There's probably a whole host of systems and methods and I'm sure I can spend many hours figuring out systems and tools and maybe even buying stuff. In fact, I'm sure I'll convince myself that buying stuff is the right solution - ranging from eye-watering eink notebooks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://remarkable.com/&quot;&gt;reMarkable&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://supernote.com/&quot;&gt;Supernotes&lt;/a&gt;, to more reasonable &lt;a href=&quot;https://getrocketbook.co.uk&quot;&gt;rocketbooks&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="Spent last night jailbreaking my older Kindle Paperwhite. This was kicked off by my desire to be able to pull out my highlights in a more automated manner on books that aren't purchased from Amazon - which is quite a lot more me. I'd found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koreader/koreader&quot;&gt;KOReader&lt;/a&gt; online and this appeared to have some automation potential with Joplin syncing, Calibre syncing or even just a SSH server on it. " created="Mon, 01 Nov 2021 12:38:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The jailbreaking is very easy, and you just follow a series of steps from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=320564&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;. It installs KUAL (Kindle Unified App Launcher), this adds a button/book that you can launch from the normal Amazon system. You keep all the same Amazon library, store, options as well which is nice. Seems like you have to be wary of OTA upgrades from Amazon which can break your jailbreak. There's some workarounds but looks like newer firmware is making it harder and harder. My kindle is quite old and I don't think it'll get any more firmware updates. They recommend putting it into Airplane mode when you don't need the internet." created="Mon, 01 Nov 2021 14:44:38 GMT">

						<outline text="Being able to rotating to landscape is a nice feature though. Again, probably won't use it." created="Mon, 01 Nov 2021 20:54:21 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I think I'm just going to use my Tiddlywiki to capture my notes, so the Joplin sync is probably too complex. Calibre might be a good way to go. I don't currently have it on my server, but probably not hard. I've never invested much time into Calibre, other than to covert epubs to mobi for kindle. However, it would be a nice way to organise my books. If I took my kindle with me, then the news feature would be good too. I think I read somewhere I can sync highlights with Calibre and then look at them there. Not sure if that's helpful or not. I can open it and copy and paste but it adds formatting I don't want even when copied as plain text. I wonder if the server version gives access to the highlights.

						<outline text="It does mean they're all in one place. I'm sure someone else on the internet has solved this problem." created="Mon, 01 Nov 2021 21:03:57 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Then there's SSH. Basically could script my server to download the highlights from the kindle automatically. Not sure if SSH is only running when the kindle is on or when asleep too. This is probably the best way if I'm going to automate syncing of highlights. However, I don't just want a copy, process and file away system as I'll never use it. Some interaction for reviewing the highlights, editing, picking, adding other notes etc. is important. It also risks spending more time automating a tiny part of it versus reviewing. I think it's between this and Calibre." created="Mon, 01 Nov 2021 21:04:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I did end up quitting KO Reader and going back to normal kindle to keep reading my book (as the place is saved).

I buy them elsewhere (or they’re free) and I load them onto the kindle. So the highlights just sit in the text file on the device. Of course I could connect it to the computer, download the file and parse it (there’s probably many scripts online to do this for me already). THEN I could benefit from it. This is never going to happen. If I could ssh or remotely connect to the kindle then I could sync stuff. Perhaps that’s worth some research. Or maybe a different ebook reader is for me.

				<outline text="But in all seriousness, I'm not buying a new computer for Windows 11. Although I do &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to buy a new computer. In fact I find it quite curious that I, as a computer aficionado, does actually only have pretty old computers. There's a few of them about but the youngest is probably the T450s ThinkPad with 5th gen intel. Windows 11 might run on it, but it's happily running GNU+Linux and my daughter uses it for her school work and so I don't have to worry about it. The others are 3rd and 4th gen intel cpus. For the past 5-6 years I've been &quot;buying a new computer&quot;. The problem is nothing seems right, and I don't want to buy something that I'll be annoyed with. It is a little bit of &lt;i&gt;don't let perfect is the enemy of good&lt;/i&gt; but my current computer isn't actually that slow - they are probably &quot;slow&quot; (benchmarks puts the new Ryzens about 3x the multithreaded performance) but nothing that has become annoying. I suspect if I used a newer computer I'd notice the difference but right now I'm ignorant to it.  I used to upgrade my computer frequently, I feel like back (~2000s) then it made a noticeable difference. I also used to play a lot of computer games and so a newer graphics card was always on the menu. I still play a few games but it's getting less and less often. I'm to the point that I should just not bother with a &quot;gaming&quot; computer as all that happens is I buy a game and then never play it. I like the idea of computer games but I just have no interest anymore. Every so often a few friends will get something and we'll play it together. That is a lot of fun but mostly as it's us all chatting together. Sometimes I think about going Apple, although the SSD tax is eye watering, and then I think about all Linux (and very occasionally some maddness over OpenBSD), or just get a laptop and be done with all desktops and computers and make the office a reading and writing room. I can't quite go without any computer or just iPad but sometimes I feel like the computer takes over too much of my life. But then I'm conflicted as I want to learn programming stuff...so yeah.

I always start off trying to use the index but often there are 30 page gaps or I just stop. I suppose I'm not making useful entries?

It's because I'm not going on my (non-Apple) computer and instead using my iPad or phone so the app is right there. I want to print out our journal from America I kept in it. Only did about 2 years but would be nice to have. Something happened to some of the photos - probably the transition between old and new DayOne apps - but I did take a backup ages ago so they're on my computer. I just need to go through each one and find the right day...I do have the json or whatever from the export so hopefully the photos are referenced in that and then I can at least skip straight to the right day. Not sure how to do this on my iPad...perhaps a combo of looking up the day on the computer from the journal text and then just adding the picture in the app on iPad. It's a bit of a chore but would make a good christmas present for my wife. I told myself it would be a good anniversary present but too late for that now. I think DayOne books are from USA, so really need to order it in next couple of weeks. Unless I export pdf and have it printed locally...anyway need to do the photos.

					<outline text="The fun of film is fixing what you get for the next 24/36 shots. I suppose midway rewinds are possible but that's just asking for trouble. The big choice is colour or black and white and then what ISO. There are other choices too but these are the main ones for me. ISO 400 is generally a good one for me as it let's me just get away with f/1.4-f/2 with 1/60s indoors and outdoors it's fine on overcast days. If it's sunny then it would be nice to make use of (generally) finer grained ISO 200 or ISO 100 films. Gives the photos a smooth, crisp look. The problem is you don't always know what you're going to be shooting, how many frames you'll use and how reliable the weather forecast is. A professional will mitigate these issues with multiple bodies or backs and probably take more photos than I would. This weekend was a particularly bad &lt;i&gt;series of unfortunate events&lt;/i&gt;, and I was all over the place. " created="Sun, 24 Oct 2021 21:02:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've been wanting to try some different black and white stocks, and had some cheap Kentmere 400. I'd also brought some Kodak ColorPlus (again cheap!) which is ISO 200. The B&amp;W was loaded first before we left and it was a beautifully sunny day. I used a whole roll without resorting to pointless shots, which is always nice, and didn't bother loading another as we were about to leave. To be organised, I decided to load the ISO 200 colour film that night ready for the next day. Oh, how grey and dull and dark is was, even outside! Trying to take pictures at 1/50s f/1.4, or trying 1/30s knowing that there's going to be movement. Clearly a flash or other light source would be helpful but I don't have one that works with my film camera. Down at f/1.4 is also pushing my focusing when everyone is running around. Oh how I wished I'd waited until the morning to load the film...there's a lesson for me...I could've pushed the film but I'm not confident cheap ColorPlus would handle that very well. I managed to use up the roll, maybe something can be salvaged from it." created="Sun, 24 Oct 2021 21:08:25 GMT">

					<outline text="So back to another roll of Kentmere for the next day. It was more mixed in weather, plus I knew I'd be taking some photos inside. I'd also brought my digital camera and it's easy to forget that it can easily push ISO 6,400 before it looks bad and in B&amp;W ISO 12,800 even looks nice. Around the house it was 2500-3000 ish. So when I switch back to ISO 400, I realise this is still going to be tricky. So I decided I'll meter it for ISO &lt;b&gt;1600&lt;/b&gt;! +2 stops. Am I mad? The cheap stock pushed two stops?! Only one way to find out...We shall see how that goes. However, at 1600 I now have plenty of latitude and can start closing that aperature down a bit.

It's more like the short posts I do on the blog vs. the long ones. However, this blog would most likely be much more active that my current one. I could also capture the long posts that I want categorised in the wiki. OR I could keep both TW and the blog and &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt; this as another blogging site. I'm thinking as my home domain, alexjj.com. That way I can still link to the blog for longer stuff I want to add (which I should also just make copies of in the wiki - or in fact draft them in the wiki) and then have the wiki for random gibbering, plus wiki stuff and then this as a slightly more refined blog/home page. I might tweak the index.html to have &quot;an about&quot; at the top.
