				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://rudimentarylathe.org/2021/10/17.html#a101131&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; I think the ordering during a day only matters if you update yourself. e.g. trying to fix x at 10am. 6 hours later &quot;I found the solution&quot;. Then in time order makes more sense. Of course with an outliner style (vs. TW) you can always just do a new level underneath. Personally speaking, I like the idea of it being in the order of the day for when I go back and look at it and remember that day. I suppose it's easy to do with just reordering levels." created="Sun, 17 Oct 2021 11:05:51 GMT"/>

					<outline text="This site is much more convenient for entering text throughout the day, and also just for general rearrangement of text. Images are a little more time consuming to setup, bit like how TW was before that uploader plugin, so not a huge deal. Plus most of the time I don't bother with images. Although I do like the little right aligned ones people drop in. " created="Sun, 17 Oct 2021 11:14:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's nice having other outliner files just here for private or draft stuff too. Or even just commenting out sections for later if I don't finish them in time." created="Sun, 17 Oct 2021 11:17:21 GMT"/>
