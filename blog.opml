Mostly just taken ones from online, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-iii-recipes/&quot;&gt;Fujix weekly's&lt;/a&gt;, or other random places. Right now I have two that I use a lot, and two others that I occasionally use but then like them when I remember. The other 3 are just entries I have to jog over to get to what I want. I should also order them in how I want to use them. E.g. top is favourite colour, then favourite B&amp;W, and last another favourite (as my custom button means I can press it then up or down to get to another custom settings).

It's more like the short posts I do on the blog vs. the long ones. However, this blog would most likely be much more active that my current one. I could also capture the long posts that I want categorised in the wiki. OR I could keep both TW and the blog and &lt;i&gt;add&lt;/i&gt; this as another blogging site. I'm thinking as my home domain, alexjj.com. That way I can still link to the blog for longer stuff I want to add (which I should also just make copies of in the wiki - or in fact draft them in the wiki) and then have the wiki for random gibbering, plus wiki stuff and then this as a slightly more refined blog/home page. I might tweak the index.html to have &quot;an about&quot; at the top. It's quite the all-in mode but this is a much better static gen site than I used to have and whilst I do like my novelty css alexjj.com landing page, it's a little pointless. hmm have to think about it some more." created="Mon, 18 Oct 2021 16:09:01 GMT" image="https://alexjj.github.io/drummer-blog/img/wiki.gif"/>

The alternatives are the 50mm f/2, nice little lens, 56mm f/1.2, the classic portrait lens and that f/1.2 but big, the 90mm f/2, appears to be the &quot;best&quot; lens ever but even bigger, then 80mm macro, supposedly the best macro but also massive." created="Sun, 17 Oct 2021 19:00:49 GMT" isComment="false">
