				<outline text="Decided (for now) instead of a GRiii(x), I should get a 18mm lens for Fuji. The f/1.4 is nice but pricey and big, so sprung for the older 18mm f/2. It's tiny, light and has a cool square metal lens hood (that makes your photos look better). It gets a lot of hate online but most likely (a) it's fine, (b) I won't be able to tell.

					<outline text="I'm interested in also getting the 60mm f/2.4 macro lens too. Another (according to the internet) a runt of the Fuji litter. I don't have anything fast in the range 50-90mm on APS-C. The macro feature tempts me for film scanning. The alternatives are the 50mm f/2, nice little lens, 56mm f/1.2, the classic portrait lens and that f/1.2 but big, the 90mm f/2, appears to be the &quot;best&quot; lens ever but even bigger, then 80mm macro, supposedly the best macro but also massive." created="Sun, 17 Oct 2021 19:00:49 GMT" isComment="false">

					<outline text="Whilst I want the 56mm, I'm not sure I'd really use it that much, and probably better getting the 50mm f/2 for speed, weight and WR. Of course the 56mm is supposed to have &lt;i&gt;character&lt;/i&gt;. The 60mm is virtually same weight as 50mm f/2 and will have more compression with a bit longer plus, again, the macro function." created="Sun, 17 Oct 2021 18:59:53 GMT"/>

					<outline text="This site is much more convenient for entering text throughout the day, and also just for general rearrangement of text. Images are a little more time consuming to setup, bit like how TW was before that uploader plugin, so not a huge deal. Plus most of the time I don't bother with images.

					<outline text="I'm not sure today. It can't replace the wiki but how should I use them together. Duplicate info? TW is just for me and drummer is for the world (so more polished?)

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://rudimentarylathe.org/2021/10/17.html#a101131&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; - I think the ordering during a day only matters if you update yourself. e.g. trying to fix x at 10am. 6 hours later &quot;I found the solution&quot;. Then in time order makes more sense. Of course with an outliner style (vs. TW) you can always just do a new level underneath. Personally speaking, I like the idea of it being in the order of the day for when I go back and look at it and remember that day. I suppose it's easy to do with just reordering levels." created="Sun, 17 Oct 2021 11:05:51 GMT"/>
